# dereks-art
This is a website which I built to store my grandfather's art

The requirements where:
* Paintings should be ordered by catagories
* A loggined in user can add new paintings
* It must be so simple that someone who rarely uses a  computer can upload  a photo of  a painting, add and edit a description
